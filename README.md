# Food Ordering Website

## Demo:  https://food-ordering-website-omkeshri.web.app/

__This project is a React-based food ordering website integrated with the Swiggy API. The application allows users to browse restaurant menus, place orders, and manage their cart with ease. Redux is utilized for efficient state management, and Tailwind CSS is used for crafting a responsive and modern design.__

__Disclaimer__: Use any CORS enable extension to access restaurant data.

## Features
- __Browse Restaurants__: Explore a wide range of restaurant menus directly from the Swiggy API.
- __Search and Filter__: Easily search for specific dishes or filter by restaurant type.
- __Add to Cart__: Seamlessly add or remove items from the cart with real-time updates.
- __Order Management__: Review and place orders with a streamlined checkout process.
- __Responsive Design__: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS. ( Will be updated soon..)

## Technologies Used
- __React__: Front-end framework for building the user interface.
- __JSX__: Syntax extension for JavaScript, used for building UI components.
- __Redux__: State management for handling the application's state.
- __Swiggy API__: Integrated to fetch real-time restaurant and menu data.
- __Tailwind CSS__: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive and modern design.
- __JavaScript (ES6+)__: Core language used for development.

## Enable CORS:
To ensure that the application can properly make API requests to the Swiggy API (or any other external API that may not have CORS enabled), you might need to enable CORS in your browser.
- Install a CORS enabling browser extension.
- After installing the extension, make sure it is enabled.
